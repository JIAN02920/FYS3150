# Project 2 - FYS3150
## Solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for two electrons in a harmonic oscillator well

In the folder `src` is all the source code related to the project. The python
framework is located in `tools/` and the test-suite in `tests/`.

Run `make` to compile code. The executable `schrodinger` is located in the
`build/`-directory. Running `python framework.py` from the `tools/` folder runs
a selected set of simulations. All graphical output is located in `plots/`
however the plots used in the article is found in `article/plots`

The code is pretty messy at the moment, and I need to work on conceptually
laying out my program-flow and interaction before I dive head first into
implementation.
