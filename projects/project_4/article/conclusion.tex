\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project we implemented the Metropolis algorithm in an effort of
simulating the Ising model for varying sizes of finite lattices. My simulations
gave me accurate results for certain models and results that did not converge
properly for others. This is extra apparent in the plots for varying grid sizes
when looking for the critical temperature. Despite these issues I feel that I
was able to answer most the questions asked in the problem text.
